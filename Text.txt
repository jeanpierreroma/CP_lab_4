Hi Celia,
 I am writing    "to you in   "order" to thank you for"   your letter. "Sorry, that "haven`t been" writing            to you so long.
I was    very busy at university    since I have a lot of homeworks.
On my opinion, history              of the Internet is           really"  amazing. It has its origin in the  efforts to build and interconnect
computer networks  .    Then in 1962 Paul Baran created the conception" of the Internet. There    were a few projects, thatâ€™s
improve    Internet e.g.   ARPANET,   TCP/IP, USENET,   NFSNET.    "Today the Internet is very important part of our life.
We can work, communicate, be realized by the Internet. "We can`t imagine our life without it.
To sum up, I    advise you to learn the history                 of the Internet,    insert information, that I wrote,
look for some
information in the Internet about. It is    really brilliant. I" am looking forward          for your reply. Good luck.
John
